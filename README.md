This package is composed of functions I find myself writing and re-using all of the time in Dart.
Coming from a pythonic background a lot of these functions are inspired from python, but there are
several different other utilities I use all the time. 

All of these functions are in pure dart and don't use any sub dependencies, so unless the language
itself changes you can be sure that using this package as dependency will be fine, and that it is
compatible on all platforms.


## Getting started

paste this in pubspec.yaml: 

    ```ari_utils_dart: ^{version number}```

import string:

```dart
import 'package:ari_utils_dart/ari_utils_dart.dart';
```
